/**
 * Created by colerogers on 7/10/16.
 * This class is for creating maps for each level
 * A map is a double-dimensional short array with the values corresponding to
 * walls and the gold pellets
 *
 * 1->left wall
 * 2->top wall
 * 4->right wall
 * 8->bottom wall
 * 16->pellet
 *
 * The numbers can be added together to form an area with walls and a pellet,
 * such as the number 19 which would mean a square with top and left walls with a pellet(1+2+16)
 *
 * The map is a 18 width by 17 height double-d array.
